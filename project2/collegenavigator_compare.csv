(-) Item not applicable,,,
"Items not applicable means an institution did not report students in 2012-13 for one or more of the student characteristics: attendance (full- or part-time); prior postsecondary experience (first-time or non-first-time); or Pell grant status. Also, some institutions may not have reported all three types of awards (certificates, Associate’s degree, or Bachelor’s degree) that they conferred because it is most likely these institutions do not offer all three type of awards.",,,
